  "statement": "Determine whether there exists an integer n > 24 such that max_{m<n}(m + τ(m)) ≤ n + 2, where τ(m) denotes the number of divisors of m.",
  "background": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Selfridge. It is known that n=24 satisfies the condition. The bound n+2 is optimal since max(τ(n-1)+n-1, τ(n-2)+n-2) ≥ n+2 always holds. Erdős conjectured that either: (1) no such n > 24 exists, or (2) if such n exist, the maximum gap grows unboundedly. Under Schinzel's Hypothesis H, for every fixed k, infinitely many n satisfy the condition when restricted to m ∈ (n-k, n).",
