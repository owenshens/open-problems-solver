  "background": "In a metric space (X,d), an open ball is B(x,r) = {y: d(x,y) < r}. A set D⊆X is dense if every nonempty open ball intersects D. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. You may use: (i) If (F_n) is a nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets with diameters tending to 0 in a complete metric space, then \u22c2_n F_n is nonempty. (ii) If U is open and x∈U, then there exists r>0 with B(x,r)⊆U.",
