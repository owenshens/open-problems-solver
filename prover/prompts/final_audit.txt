You are performing final verification of an integrated mathematical proof.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
{problem_statement}

FULL PROOF:
{full_proof}

RELEVANT LITERATURE (for cross-checking):
{literature_context}

TASK:
Perform final verification of this integrated proof. Check both individual correctness AND integration quality.

AUDIT PROTOCOL:
1. Verify each lemma is cited where claimed
2. Check for hidden lemmas introduced in the main argument
3. Check for missing glue steps between lemmas
4. Check global consistency: any conflicting assumptions across lemmas?
5. Assess overall coherence and mathematical rigor
6. Verify the proof actually establishes the claimed statement

OUTPUT FORMAT (valid JSON only):
{{
  "verdict": "PASS|FAIL|UNCERTAIN",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "issues": [
    {{
      "severity": "critical|major|minor",
      "location": "description of where in proof",
      "summary": "brief description",

  ],
  "feedback": "Overall assessment of the integrated proof",
  "missing_links": ["lemma X stated but never used", ...],
  "global_consistency": "description of any conflicting assumptions",
  "recommendation": "accept|revise|reject"
}}

VERDICT RULES:
- PASS: The full argument is sound and complete. All lemmas are used correctly. Confidence 0.7-1.0.
- FAIL: There are gaps, missing connections, or logical errors in the integration.
- UNCERTAIN: You cannot verify key integration steps without additional information.

INTEGRATION CHECKS:
- Do all lemma statements appear in the final proof?
- Are they cited in the correct dependency order?
- Are there any "gaps" where lemmas jump to conclusions?
- Are there any circular dependencies or hidden assumptions?

GLOBAL CONSISTENCY:
- Check that assumptions across different lemmas don't conflict
- Check that all quantifiers are used consistently
- Check that notation is used consistently throughout

RECOMMENDATION LEVELS:
- accept: Proof is ready as-is (PASS with confidence ≥ 0.8)
- revise: Proof has issues but is salvageable with repairs (FAIL or UNCERTAIN)
- reject: Proof has fundamental flaws that cannot be easily repaired (FAIL with critical issues)

IMPORTANT:
Return valid JSON ONLY. No markdown, no prose outside JSON.
