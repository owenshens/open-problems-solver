You are summarizing a proved lemma into a compact interface for downstream use.

LEMMA ID: {lemma_id}

LEMMA STATEMENT:
{lemma_statement}

PROOF:
{lemma_proof}

TASK:
Extract a concise interface that downstream lemmas can use. This should be a self-contained summary that allows other proofs to cite this result without reading the full proof.

OUTPUT FORMAT (text, not JSON):

**Lemma {lemma_id}:** [Concise restatement of what was proved]

**Assumptions:** [List all assumptions needed, in order]

**Result:** [Precise statement of what holds]

**Usage notes:** [How to apply this result: what hypotheses must be checked, what conclusion follows]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Be precise: include all necessary hypotheses
2. Be concise: aim for ≤ 300 words total
3. Use clear mathematical notation
4. Avoid internal proof details (just state what was proved and under what conditions)
5. If the result has natural corollaries or special cases, mention them briefly

EXAMPLE:

**Lemma L2:** Continuous images of compact sets are compact.

**Assumptions:**
- f: X → Y is a continuous function
- K ⊆ X is a compact subset
- X and Y are topological spaces

**Result:** The image f(K) is compact in Y.

**Usage notes:** To apply, verify (1) f is continuous, (2) K is compact in domain. Then f(K) is automatically compact in codomain. Useful for proving boundedness results via continuous functions on compact domains.
