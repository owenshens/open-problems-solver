You are auditing a mathematical proof for correctness. Be adversarial.

CLAIM:
{lemma_statement}

ASSUMPTIONS:
{lemma_assumptions}

PROOF:
{lemma_proof}

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC AUDIT TESTS:
{domain_audit_tests}

KNOWN OBSTACLES AND PITFALLS FROM LITERATURE:
{literature_context}

TASK:
Critically evaluate this proof. Assume it may be wrong. Your job is to find flaws, not to be generous.

AUDIT PROTOCOL:
1. Verify the statement matches what is proved
2. Check each step [S#] for validity
3. Attempt to construct a counterexample if any step seems too strong
4. Check edge cases and quantifier order
5. Verify all assumptions and dependencies are used correctly
6. Check for gaps, circular reasoning, or unjustified leaps

OUTPUT FORMAT (valid JSON only):
{{
  "verdict": "PASS|FAIL|UNCERTAIN",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "issues": [
    {{
      "severity": "critical|major|minor",
      "location": "[S#]",
      "summary": "brief description",
      "detail": "detailed explanation",
      "patch": "minimal fix suggestion"
    }}
  ],
  "feedback": "Overall assessment of the proof quality"
}}

VERDICT RULES:
- PASS: The proof is complete and every step is justified. Confidence should reflect certainty (0.7-1.0).
- FAIL: There is a critical gap, incorrect inference, or missing hypothesis. Must cite specific step labels.
- UNCERTAIN: You cannot verify a key step, even if no explicit error is found. Explain what additional verification would be needed.

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- critical: Proof fails completely (logical error, missing hypothesis, circular reasoning)
- major: Proof has a gap that needs significant repair (missing case, unjustified step)
- minor: Proof is essentially correct but has unclear notation or minor issues

IMPORTANT:
- Always cite step labels [S#] when identifying issues
- If FAIL or UNCERTAIN, provide actionable feedback for improvement
- Be specific: vague feedback like "not rigorous enough" is not helpful
