Generate {num_strategies} diverse decomposition strategies for the BLOCKED lemma.

LEMMA (BLOCKED):
Lemma ID: {lemma_id}
Statement: {lemma_statement}
Assumptions: {lemma_assumptions}

BLOCKING REASON:
{blocking_reason}

PRIOR CONTEXT (what has been tried):
{context_summary}

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
Domain: {problem_domain}
Background: {problem_background}

CURRENT STATE:
- Depth: {current_depth} / {max_depth}

YOUR TASK:
Generate {num_strategies} DISTINCT, PROMISING decomposition strategies. Each strategy should:

1. **Have a clear rationale** - Explain why this decomposition approach might work
2. **Be different from others** - Each strategy should use a different mathematical technique
3. **Avoid failed approaches** - Don't repeat strategies from context that already failed
4. **Be viable** - Ensure there's room for decomposition (depth < max_depth)

STRATEGY TYPES TO CONSIDER:

**Horizontal Decomposition:**
- Break into parallel sub-goals (all needed to prove parent)
- Example: "Prove A and B separately, then combine"

**Vertical Decomposition:**
- Create a chain of lemmas where each builds on previous
- Example: "First prove L1, then use it to prove L2, then use both for parent"

**Case Analysis:**
- Split by cases based on problem structure
- Example: "Consider case n even vs n odd separately"

**Helper Lemmas:**
- Introduce auxiliary results that make the proof easier
- Example: "First establish a helper inequality, then use it in main proof"

**Strengthen/Weaken:**
- Prove a stronger claim (easier to use later) or weaken assumptions
- Example: "Prove a stronger upper bound first"

**Granular Breakdown:**
- Very fine-grained decomposition into tiny, obvious steps
- Example: "Break into 4-6 very simple lemmas"

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Diverse strategies** - Don't generate 3 variants of the same approach
2. **Context-aware** - Learn from failed_strategies and integration_failures
3. **Ordered by promise** - Most promising strategy first
4. **Specific rationale** - Explain exactly why this might work for THIS lemma

Generate exactly {num_strategies} strategies, ordered by estimated promise (best first).
