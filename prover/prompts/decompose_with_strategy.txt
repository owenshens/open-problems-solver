Decompose the lemma following the SPECIFIC decomposition strategy provided.

LEMMA TO DECOMPOSE:
Lemma ID: {lemma_id}
Statement: {lemma_statement}
Assumptions: {lemma_assumptions}

DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY (FOLLOW THIS):
{strategy_rationale}

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
Domain: {problem_domain}
Background: {problem_background}

CURRENT STATE:
- Depth: {current_depth} / {max_depth}

YOUR TASK:
Generate 2-6 sub-lemmas that FOLLOW the decomposition strategy above.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Follow the strategy** - The sub-lemmas must align with the strategy rationale
   - If strategy says "horizontal split", create parallel independent sub-goals
   - If strategy says "vertical chain", create sequential dependencies
   - If strategy says "case analysis", split by cases
   - If strategy says "helper lemma", introduce auxiliary results first

2. **Simplicity** - Each sub-lemma must be SIMPLER than the parent
   - Fewer quantifiers, shorter statement, more concrete
   - Ideally "one-shot provable" without further decomposition

3. **Completeness** - Sub-lemmas must TOGETHER imply the parent
   - No logical gaps
   - Composition path must be clear

4. **Clean dependencies** - Form a valid DAG
   - Sub-lemmas can depend on each other
   - Dependencies must be explicit in the "dependencies" field
   - Use IDs like "1", "2", "3" for sub-lemmas (will be auto-prefixed)

5. **Proof strategy** - Explain how sub-lemmas prove the parent
   - Make the integration path explicit
   - Show how the strategy achieves the goal

EXAMPLE (for strategy "Horizontal split: continuity + boundedness"):
{{
  "lemmas": [
    {{
      "id": "1",
      "statement": "f is continuous on [a,b]",
      "assumptions": ["f: [a,b] → ℝ", "f compact"],
      "dependencies": []
    }},
    {{
      "id": "2",
      "statement": "f is bounded on [a,b]",
      "assumptions": ["f: [a,b] → ℝ", "f compact"],
      "dependencies": []
    }},
    {{
      "id": "3",
      "statement": "Continuous + bounded implies attains max/min",
      "assumptions": [],
      "dependencies": ["1", "2"]
    }}
  ],
  "proof_strategy": "Lemmas 1 and 2 establish key properties independently. Lemma 3 combines them to prove the parent statement about attaining extrema."
}}

OUTPUT FORMAT (valid JSON only):
{{
  "lemmas": [
    {{
      "id": "1",
      "statement": "[Clear, specific mathematical statement aligned with strategy]",
      "assumptions": ["[Explicit assumptions]"],
      "dependencies": []
    }},
    {{
      "id": "2",
      "statement": "[Another sub-lemma following the strategy]",
      "assumptions": ["[Assumptions]"],
      "dependencies": ["1"]  // if depends on lemma 1
    }}
  ],
  "proof_strategy": "[Explain how these sub-lemmas, following the strategy, prove the parent]"
}}

REMEMBER: Your decomposition must FOLLOW the strategy rationale provided above!
