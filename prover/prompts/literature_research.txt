You are researching existing proofs and mathematical approaches for a theorem.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
{problem_statement}

BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE:
{problem_background}

MATHEMATICAL DOMAIN:
{problem_domain}

WEB SEARCH RESULTS:
{search_results}

TASK:
Synthesize the literature to extract actionable information for proving this theorem.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
1. **Standard Approaches**: What are the typical proof strategies for this type of result?
2. **Key Lemmas**: What intermediate results are commonly used?
3. **Proof Techniques**: What mathematical techniques are most effective?
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Where do proofs typically fail or require extra care?
5. **Variations & Cases**: Are there different versions or special cases to consider?

SYNTHESIS PROTOCOL:
- Prioritize academic sources (papers, textbooks) over informal sources
- Extract concrete, actionable information (specific lemmas, techniques)
- Note when multiple sources agree (high confidence) vs. single source (verify)
- Identify the most reliable and prevalent approaches

OUTPUT FORMAT (structured text, not JSON):

## Recommended Strategy
[Based on synthesis, what's the most reliable approach?]
**Primary Strategy:** [Recommended approach based on literature]
**Fallback Strategy:** [Alternative if primary fails]
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low based on source agreement]

## Source Summary
[Brief assessment of search results quality]
- Academic sources found: [count]
- Textbook references: [count]
- Informal sources: [count]
- Overall confidence in findings: [High/Medium/Low]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Be specific: provide concrete lemma statements when available
2. Be critical: note uncertainty when sources disagree or info is incomplete
3. Be actionable: focus on information that helps proof planning
4. Be concise: prioritize quality over quantity (aim for 500-1000 words total)

IMPORTANT:
If search results are insufficient or unreliable, explicitly state limitations and recommend proceeding with standard domain techniques.
